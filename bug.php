In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with object references and their modification within functions. Consider this scenario:

```php
class MyClass {
    public $value = 10;
}

function modifyObject(MyClass $obj) {
    $obj->value = 20; // Modifying the object's property
}

$myObj = new MyClass();
echo $myObj->value; // Outputs 10
modifyObject($myObj);
echo $myObj->value; // Outputs 20 (as expected)
}
```

This works as intended. However, if the object is passed by value instead of by reference, changes inside the function won't affect the original object. This might be less obvious if you're dealing with complex objects or if the function modifies the object in a non-obvious way.  The problem becomes apparent when dealing with functions that return objects or values that are reassigned.  The programmer may mistakenly assume that all object changes are reflected back to the original object passed into a function.

```php
class MyClass {
    public $value = 10;
}

function modifyObject(MyClass $obj) {
    $obj = new MyClass(); // Creating a new object, overwriting parameter
    $obj->value = 20;
    return $obj; // Returning a new object
}

$myObj = new MyClass();
echo $myObj->value; // Outputs 10
$myObj = modifyObject($myObj); //Reassignment is crucial here.  The original object is untouched.
echo $myObj->value; //Outputs 20. The original object has NOT been modified.
}
