The solution involves understanding that in the original `modifyObject` function, a new object is created and assigned to `$obj` inside the function. This leaves the original object unchanged. To correct this, there are two main approaches:

**1. Pass by Reference:**

Modify the function signature to pass the object by reference using the `&` symbol:

```php
function modifyObject(MyClass &$obj) {
    $obj->value = 20; // Now modifies the original object
}
```

This ensures that any changes made within the function directly affect the original object.

**2. Explicit Return and Reassignment (If creating a new object is the intent):**

If a new object is intentionally being created within the function and the original object should be replaced by a new one, explicitly return and reassign the new object.

```php
function modifyObject(MyClass $obj) {
    $obj = new MyClass(); // Creating a new object
    $obj->value = 20;
    return $obj; // Returning the new object
}

$myObj = new MyClass();
echo $myObj->value; // Outputs 10
$myObj = modifyObject($myObj); // Reassignment is key here.  The original object is discarded and replaced by the new object.
echo $myObj->value; //Outputs 20.  The original object has been overwritten.
}
```

Choosing the correct approach depends on the intended behavior of your function. If you intend to modify the original object in place, pass by reference. If you intend to replace the original object with a newly created one, return the new object and reassign it to the original variable.
